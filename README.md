## ‚ö°Ô∏è What is GraphQL?

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. It gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need ‚Äî nothing more, nothing less ‚Äî and makes APIs fast, flexible, and developer-friendly.

## üì¶ What is WPGraphQL?

WPGraphQL is a WordPress plugin that adds a GraphQL API to your WordPress site.

This allows developers to:
- Fetch content from WordPress using GraphQL queries
- Replace or supplement the REST API
- Integrate WordPress with modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, or Gatsby

## ‚úÖ Features

- Full CRUD access to posts, pages, categories, tags, users, menus, media, etc.
- Extensible through custom post types, taxonomies, fields, and resolvers
- Works with popular plugins like ACF, WooCommerce, and Yoast via extensions
- Strongly typed schema with introspection support
- Developer-friendly tools and GraphiQL explorer
